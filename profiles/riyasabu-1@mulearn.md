- The initiatives of KSUM present huge opportunities for students to improve their creative thinking skills and put forward ideas for a better future.
- The government's support initiatives, exemplified by the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), play a pivotal role in nurturing the tech ecosystem. Financial incentives, mentorship programs, and infrastructure development all contribute to the ecosystem's growth and success.
